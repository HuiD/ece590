Project: Multiplayer Bomberman
group 07
Group Member: Hui Dong, Ran Zhang, Tianxu Wang


We used SDL as our game engine and the game can be run under Linux environment (we use Ubuntu 12.04 LTS as our development environment.).

For the network part, we used SDL_Net to enable multiplay over the LAN. We also referenced the online sdl tutorials at http://www.sdltutorials.com/ and used and modified their libraries.

We included SDL_TTF and SDL_Mixer in our game for Heads Up Display and audio of the game.
